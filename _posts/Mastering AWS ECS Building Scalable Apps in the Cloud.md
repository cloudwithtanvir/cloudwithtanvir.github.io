## Part 3: Let's Do It - Using AWS Fargate and ECS

### What to Expect
Embark on a practical journey where we will guide you through the step-by-step process of setting up AWS Fargate and ECS. From creating clusters to deploying containers, you'll be launching your first scalable application in no time.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Create ECS Clusters
Navigate to the AWS Management Console and open the ECS Dashboard. Click on "Clusters" and then "Create Cluster." Follow the prompts to configure your cluster, specifying details such as cluster name, networking, and instance type. Basically it will create and run the cloudformation stack to complete this step.
